# Specs:

- Add attributes to the blog
- Add edit functionality
- Add CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations
- Understand MVC frameworks
- Understand routing with mapping urls to templates
- Use HTML/CSS for front-end (no frameworks)
- Understand how to send POST requests to the server with user data from forms
- Learn basic user validation (limit what pages they can see)
